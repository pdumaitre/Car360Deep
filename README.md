# Car360Deep
Deep learning for computer vision on car pictures.

## What is Car360Deep?
Car360Deep is a project aimed at creating and developping convolutional neural networks for computer vision, applied to car pictures.
We work on the dataset described in this research paper: 3D Object Representations for Fine-Grained Categorization
       Jonathan Krause, Michael Stark, Jia Deng, Li Fei-Fei
       4th IEEE Workshop on 3D Representation and Recognition, at ICCV 2013 (3dRR-13). Sydney, Australia. Dec. 8, 2013.

The dataset is available here: http://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html (we'll call it "the website").

## What is in there?

- Metadata, that can be found in the devkitCSV folder.
It is a modified version of the devkit available on the website.
The .mat files have been converted to .csv, and then cleaned, using python scripts which are also in this folder.

- Data is NOT in there, but can be found on the website.


## How does it work ?

## How do I install it?

## How do I use it?

## How do I test it?
